# FallingSand
This is a basic falling sand game with a GUI. 
When you run this code a blank canvas appears with a column of five materials: Water, lava, metal, sand, obsidian.
You're also given an option to "Clear Board". Click the clear board button and then click on your canvas. All entities on the 
board will disappear giving you a fresh canvas.
